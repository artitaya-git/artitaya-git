## Hi, I'm Artitaya ðŸ‘‹
**Iâ€™m a self-taught programmer passionate about blockchain, generative AI, and web development.**  

I started with Processing (Java, P5.js) a year ago and have since expanded into:  
- Python + frameworks  
- JavaScript + frameworks  
- Solidity
- Sui Move  

With a background in art and education, I blend creativity with code to explore virtual economies and decentralized technologies. Here, youâ€™ll find my small projects and experiments as I refine my skills and contribute to the future of the decentralized web.  

**Feel free to connect with me!**
